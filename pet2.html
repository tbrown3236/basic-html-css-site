				<h4>Customer Reviews</h4>
					<p>
					i am very happy with my purchase. The quality of the brush is wonderful. I have a long hair doxie that requires daily grooming, and the 2 in 1 Comb rake combo is ideal for the dog. The brush is gentle yet tough enough to get right through my pet's hair. What I've noticed is there is much less sheeding and Max (my dog) really is cooperative at brushing- something I have had trouble with in the past.
					For pet owners that like to pamper and care for their dogs, I highly recommend this brush.<br>

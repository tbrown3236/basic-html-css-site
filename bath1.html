				<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>
					All these can now change. Thanks to this new technological advancement by British inventor James Dyson, the faucet can now serve as a hand dryer too. He incorporates a high-speed dryer into the faucet, which helps dry hands in as fast as 12 seconds using a 420mph blast of air. That is almost three times faster drying time compared to conventional dryers that take around 43 seconds to dry hands. It is equipped with infrared sensors that determine hand positions before water or air is dispensed. You need not worry about bacteria because the inventor assures that the fixtureâ€™s HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) filter catches 99.9% of bacteria and viruses floating inside common bathrooms. It claims that the air being blown from the fixture is clean.<br><br>

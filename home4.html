				<h4>Customer Reviews</h4>
					<p>
				I am a pretty big tech geek, and the smart home stuff has become a big interest for me recently. I can control my sprinklers and garage door from my phone/PC, and wanted to do the same with my thermostat. I had looked into the Nest and ecobee smart thermostats but both had limitations that held me back from actually buying them (see below). When I first saw this new Honeywell thermostat, it finally had everything I wanted and pushed me to actually go out and buy it.<br>

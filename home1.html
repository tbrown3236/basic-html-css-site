				<h4>Customer Reviews</h4>
					<p>
				Great idea, and seems well made, but item did not work at all. Took forever to get the software set up right and connected to wi-fi, but after being in touch with the company and trying everything under the sun, no video was ever achieved. The company offered to keep troubleshooting it with me, but I was tired of the hassle and returned it for a full refund. Seems like this product was released way too soon, with kinks galore. Once they're worked out, it may be a very snazzy and useful unit<br>
